					<p><b>Davy</b>, while not the <i>main</i> protagonist, is one of four others in and the poster child of <a href="#"><i>Chameleon Twist</i></a>.</p>
					<p>Davy was originally an ordinary blue chameleon. However, after jumping into a pot of unknown power and origin, he gained the ability to have opposable thumbs. Strangely, his tongue  was kept more or less the same.</p>
					<p>Not many solid credits exist for the creation of Davy (as is the rest of <i>Chameleon Twist</i>), but <b>Tadashi Ohya</b> is credited for the original chameleon design<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>, and therefore Davy in the process. Furthermore, there are 5 artists credited in the art direction of <i>Chameleon Twist</i>. These are, in order of appearance; <b>Takashi Makino</b>, <b>Yuki Tamura</b>, <b>Hiroyuki Morioka</b>, <b>Mitsuyasu Nomoto</b>, and <b>Hideki Shibagaki</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Given that the first three names are credited towards <i>Computer</i> Arts and the last two are credited towards <i>Graphic</i> Arts, it can be safely assumed that <b>Mitsuyasu Nomoto</b> and <b>Hideki Shibagaki</b> had some input for the chameleons' designs.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>Throughout the development of <i>Chameleon Twist</i>, there was only one constant: Davy and his body. While technically not verbatim, Davy and his design has seen <i>Chameleon Twist</i> from its humble beginnings to its own bitter end. The first iteration of Davy documented is an extremely primative design made up of nothing but spheres and cylinders. Sadly, only his backside can be seen in the currently available screenshots.  There has not been a screenshot yet of Davy's face in these intial test demos. From what is seen, it seems as if Davy has either a saddened, <a hred="#">Fred</a>-esque look, or resting grouch face. Regardless of the interpretation, his eyes are half shut. Even worse, we don't even get to see his pupils! Notable missing features other than what was just mentioned include lack of cheeks, backpack, skin markings,  shoulder cuffs, and shoe cuffs. Notable differences include the shoes being fully white. Other than these differences, that's the dude we all know and love. In the flesh.</p><br2 style="margin:4.6%"></br2>

                            </div>
                            <p>The next notable incarnation is a singluar screenshot of the supposed 'battle mode'. The design, assuming that is indeed our beloved Davy, is near identical to the first iteration. The key difference is that this chameleon is nothing <i>but</i> blue! This can be presumedly because of battle mode being color coded. The only other notable difference is that the other player's tongue is more sharp and jagged. It can assumed that this applies to Davy as well.</p><br2 style="margin:9%"></br2>

                            <p>The next iteration in our list is ANOTHER lone screenshot. This time of a scrapped water-based section. Here, the design starts to meld into the limitations of the Nintendo 64. The model becomes jagged and sharp. The infamous backpack is now included as well as cuffs! Hooray! Still no cheeks or body markings yet, but that's him!</p><br2 style="margin:8%"></br2>

                            </div>
                            <p>This design can be most commonly seen in the Space World 1996 build that was shown off. We can now clearly see his eyes, the cuff colors were swapped, and he now has genuine gloves instead of flesh hands. He even has his 'iconic' 2 plastered on his chest. With cheeks to boot, this design looks near identical model wise to the previous, much like how the second Demo Davy looked similar to the first. However, in this case, we actually get to see the design in action! The actions performed inside of the Space World 1996 build looks pretty similar to what was in the final release, minus some battle mode shenanigans and the Mega-Vault. We are getting there!</p><br2 style="margin:11.8%"></br2>

                            <p>This last beta iteration is like a mid-point between the final and the Space World 1996 build. In fact, it closely resembles the low-poly versions used in Battle Game. The eye texture seems to be ripped directly from the Space World 1996 build. The backpack straps are visible, and the shoes seem to be made up of two colors. One detraction however is that the hands are now flat colors, suggesting that they are either mere textures or that the lighting was REALLY subdued. This is taken from <b>Hideyuki Nakanishi</b>'s biography page<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>. Said image also contains an early version of <a href="#">Ant Land</a>. There are very minor changes, but it looks as if we are nearing the final build.</p><br2 style="margin:7.2%"></br2>

                            <p>And here we are! This is Davy's model ripped straight from the game! It contains nearly no trace of the old models. It is overall a graphical upgrade, so one can imagine that they prioritized their designs last to fit within memory constraints, and they did a knock-up job! Here is a list of all the differences from the last:
                            <li>His head is now properly round.</li>
                            <li>The sizes of the cuffs are generally longer, as well as the limbs.</li>
                            <li>The eye textures are now shaded and have a shine acting as if a light is to the top right.</li>
                            <li>The 2 is a more saturated pink (at least compared to the low quality).</li>
                            <li>The fists now have proper textures for the digits. (However for Davy exclusively his right hand is improperly mapped.)</li>
                            <li>The shoes aren't just triangles.</li>
                                Overall, the model is infinitely more polished and looks much nicer (objectively). However, it is NOTHING compared to the render! </p><br2 style="margin:9.95%"></br2>

                            </div>
                            <p>This one is generally for fun, and there are other models not included in this list. However, this is one of the many renders people use / know <i>Chameleon Twist</i> by. Because of this fact, let's break it down!
                            <li>His head is now properly round. Actually this time.</li>
                            <li>The shoulder cuffs are simple circles. This could be an artistic interpretation or the original intent, based off of other extraneous artwork of the chameleons.</li>
                            <li>The shoe cuffs resemble socks, much like <i>Sonic The Hedgehog</i>.</li>
                            <li>The eyes are fully modeled. The light is no longer baked in (because it's a render!) and the eyes are now extruded from the head.</li>
                            <li>The cheeks are also extruded.</li>
                            <li>The hands now have individual digits. What a surprise.</li>
                            <li>The shoes look similar but round enough to be distinct.</li>
                            <li>The eyes are more similar to <a href="#">Jack</a> than Davy when compared to the in-game designs.</li>
                            <li>The body is more round and rotund. In fact, the entire design reeks of the design of Classic Sonic.</li>
                                Unsurprisingly, this interpretation is much more detailed and high quality than the in-game counterpart. However, it feels just off-putting enough to be unsettling. To each their own I suppose.</p>

                            <p>Amazingly, the series was greenlit for a second go-round. Here, the chameleons got... <i>interesting</i> overhauls. On the Japanese side, they look teh same as ever! Maybe they got a couple more polygons and 10$ more in shading, but at the cost of their number. Oh the horror!
                            <li>The main blue is much more saturated.</li>
                            <li>Cuffs use their in-game look rather than artwork..</li>
                            <li>The eyes are smaller overall, taking up less space on the... face.</li>
                            <li>Bye bye two!  We now have letters!</li>
                            <li>Your gloves are red now. That's my attack.</li>
                            <li>The shoes have soles.</li>
                            <li>The cheeks have a gradient similar to the eyes.</li>
                            <li>The top part of the body is now white, as well as the wrists.</li>
                            <li>The backpack is now red.</li>
                                With the existence of costumes, it could be possbile that the new white parts on the body is some form of clothing. However, without developer confirmation, this is left ambigious. But forget clothes because...</p><br2 style="margin:1.49%"></br2>

                            <li>His head is... anatomically correct? Close enough.</li>
                            <li>He's green now. In accordance <a href="#">Jack</a> has now been turned blue.</li>

This was most likely done for that sole reason of being more marketable to the generation, but it clashes heavily with the silly and fun filled aesthetic that the series is known for.
